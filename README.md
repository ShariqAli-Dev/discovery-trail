# Discovery Trail

Discovery Trail is an ai powered course generation platform. You can create multiple courses for yourself or choose to share them with friends.

This project is less about the user facing application and more about the underlying go web server in control of everything. This is a well known paradigm that I wanted to improve upon with the use of HTMX, opposed to modern frameworks/libraries like Vite, Angular, & React.
